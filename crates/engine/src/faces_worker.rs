//! The heavy part of scanning faces, run off the session thread, on a few threads at once.
//!
//! For one photo: render it (upright, uncropped, default settings), find its faces with the YuNet detector (when installed)
//! so each region can be aligned by landmarks, cut each region out and run the recognition model. A photo that has
//! no face regions at all and has not been searched yet also gets its detections back, with their embeddings, so the
//! scan decodes each photo once. The session thread only prepares the job (which needs the catalog) and later ingests
//! the result, so the window never waits for a model.
