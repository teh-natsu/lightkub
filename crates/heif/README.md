# lightcraft-heif

The optional HEIF / HEIC decoder of LightKub: iPhone and Mac photos. [`heic-rs`](https://github.com/tbraun96/heic-rs)
(pure Rust, no `unsafe`, MIT OR Apache-2.0, written from the H.265 / HEIF specifications) reads the
container and reconstructs the HEVC pictures; this crate turns them into 16-bit RGB itself so the
result matches libheif to within one code value:

- the colour description is the item's `colr nclx` (or its first tile's), else the HEVC VUI
  (iPhones: full range), else the H.265 defaults; an unspecified matrix is BT.601. heic-rs alone
  assumes BT.709 limited range, about 8 code values off on every iPhone photo;
- chroma is upsampled by nearest neighbour, or centred bilinear when a `clap` starts on an odd
  pixel, as libheif does;
- `imir` axis 0 flips top and bottom, as libheif writes and reads it (heic-rs names it the other way);
- a grid's ICC profile may sit on its tiles.

Single pictures and grid-tiled photos, 4:2:0 and monochrome, 8- to 10-bit, alpha auxiliary images
(other auxiliary images — HDR gain maps, depth — are ignored), the container's rotation/mirror/crop,
ICC, EXIF and XMP, and the file's thumbnail item. 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 (Canon/Sony "HIF") are refused
with `Error::Unsupported`: heic-rs 0.1.1 loses sync on them. Read-only.

```rust
let info = lightcraft_heif::probe(&bytes)?;           // size, depth, alpha: check limits first
let img = lightcraft_heif::decode(&bytes, &lightcraft_heif::Options::default())?;
// img.width, img.height, img.has_alpha, img.bit_depth, img.data (RGB/RGBA u16), img.colour, img.icc, img.exif, img.xmp
let thumb = lightcraft_heif::decode_thumbnail(&bytes, 256, &Default::default())?; // Option<Decoded>
```

Errors are `Error::Unsupported` (image sequences, overlays, 4:2:2/4:4:4, …), `Error::Limit` or
`Error::Malformed`. It never panics: every call into heic-rs runs under `catch_unwind`, and a panic
inside it (PhotoCraft's fuzzing found two in 0.1.1) becomes `Error::Malformed`.

Feature `testdata` exposes `lightcraft_heif::testdata`: lossless synthetic HEIF files (PCM-coded
32 × 32 HEVC pictures, grids, every property above) for the tests of the crates above.

## Why it is a separate, optional crate

- **A young decoder.** heic-rs is new and has a single maintainer. It is pinned exactly
  (`=0.1.1`); moving the pin is a reviewed change (re-run the crate tests and
  `cargo test -p lightcraft-codecs --features heif`). The other permissive candidates were
  rejected: heif-oxide's HEVC decoder (rust_h265) follows FFmpeg's (LGPL) code structure, and
  gamut-heic has no HEVC decoder of its own.
- **HEVC patents are a distributor's call.** `lightcraft-codecs` uses this crate only behind its
  non-default `heif` feature; the apps forward it and the release packages enable it. Without it,
  HEIC files are still recognised and opening one is a clear "HEIC/HEIF support isn't included in
  this build" error — the same policy as PhotoCraft.

The crate depends on no other LightKub crate; `codecs` → `heif` is the only edge between them.
