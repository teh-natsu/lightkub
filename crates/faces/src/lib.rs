//! Face models for LightKub: what a model is ([`ModelManifest`]), whether to trust a description of one
//! ([`manifest::validate`]), the models we know by hash ([`known`]), and a probe that reads an unknown
//! `.onnx` file's input and output shapes without running it ([`onnx`]), so installing a model of your
//! own can be one drop and one licence prompt.
//!
//! Everything here treats model files and manifests as hostile input: sizes are capped, numbers must be
//! finite and sane, and a malformed file is an error, never a panic. Detection and recognition run
//! on the same checked, single-thread pure-Rust CPU interpreter.
