//! Clip-aware highlight handling on demosaiced camera RGB (before white balance, white level = 1.0).
//!
//! - [`clip_neutral`]: white-balance-aware clipping so that sensor-clipped areas render neutral instead of
//!   magenta/cyan (each channel limited to the smallest white-balanced clip level).
//! - [`reconstruct`] / [`reconstruct_with`]: where only some channels are clipped, rebuild them from the
//!   unclipped channels using the chromaticity of reliable unclipped content nearby (bright, away from edges and
//!   from the clipped pixels themselves; diffused into the clipped region coarse to fine) unless both the pixel's
//!   own channels and the clipped surface's colour just below its clip (the rim) contradict it, and neutral where
//!   there is none within reach. Right past the rim, the rim's colour carries on. Fully clipped pixels become
//!   neutral at the brightest plausible level; partly clipped ones fade into it on their way from the first channel
//!   clipping to the last, pale ones from the start.
//! - [`reconstruct_masked`]: the same for a binned image, whose clipped channels a mask tells (block means with a
//!   clipped sample among them).
//!
//! Why the care: the white-balance gains push clipped channels apart (green clips first, red and blue keep
//! rising), so whatever colour the rebuilt pixels carry is hidden at Neutral only by the tone map's roll-off to
//! white. Any darkening (Highlights, negative Exposure or Whites) brings it out. Three things used to leak colour
//! in: the chromaticity of whatever unclipped pixel happened to be nearest (dark foliage, purple and green
//! fringes along branches, pixels demosaiced from clipped neighbours); a colour model that does not render the
//! camera's white-balanced neutral as neutral (a look fitted to the camera's JPEG, a camera profile); and, in a
//! pale partly clipped sky, the colour of another reliable surface (bright foliage) and the sky's own faint
//! colour, which darkening and a camera profile turned teal.
