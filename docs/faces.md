# Faces

LightKub reads the face names other apps (Lightroom, digiKam…) write into your photos, shows them in the loupe
(boxes you can switch off, resize and remove) and groups photos by person in the People view. This page is about the
*models* that find and recognise faces by themselves.

## Nothing is bundled; every model is an opt-in download

No model weights are part of LightKub. Each one is a file you choose to get, from **Settings ▸ Faces**:

- **Face detection:** [YuNet](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/tree/main/models/face_detection_yunet) (232 KB, MIT).
  It runs in LightKub's own code, with no extra runtime. It was trained on the WIDER FACE dataset; an MIT licence on
  weights does not settle that dataset's terms, so this is flagged for the maintainer. It finds faces; it does not
  identify anyone. **Photo ▸ Detect Faces** offers the download the first time you use it.
- **Face recognition models** are large (AuraFace is 261 MB), and their licences and training data deserve a decision by
  the person installing them. Everything works without one: names from XMP, the People view, the face boxes.
- **Recognition runs in LightKub's own pure-Rust CPU interpreter**, shared with the detector. Dense
  convolutions use bounded im2col and single-thread float32 GEMM (ndarray 0.17.2 / matrixmultiply 0.3.11, MIT or Apache-2.0, default/BLAS/threading features disabled);
  depthwise convolutions use row-wise Rust loops. There is no nested thread pool. No C or assembly is compiled by
  this dependency path. Desktop and CLI builds always include recognition (there is no separate cargo feature for it). The browser retains its existing model-install/background-scan restrictions.

### Supported graphs and limits

The pinned SFace 2021dec and AuraFace v1 files both use ONNX opset 11. Their combined operators are **Conv** (including
SFace's depthwise groups), **BatchNormalization**, **PRelu**, **Add**, **Sub**, **Mul**, **Dropout** (inference identity),
**Flatten**, and **Gemm**. The shared engine also supports the detector's Relu, Sigmoid, MaxPool, nearest whole-number
Resize, Transpose and constant-shape Reshape, plus GlobalAveragePool and Identity. This is a limited inference engine:
other operators (including MatMul and Concat), custom domains, training graphs, unsupported attribute combinations,
external/sparse weights and non-float32 inputs/outputs fail to load with an explicit error.

Shapes and attributes are checked before installation's self-test, including all intermediates and the promised output
size. Files are limited to 512 MiB, combined weights to 64 Mi elements (256 MiB of float32), rank to eight and live tensors plus
retained convolution scratch to 512 MiB. All supplied weights and produced activations must be finite. Embeddings retain the
manifest's RGB/BGR and mean/std preprocessing, and are normalized using a bounded float64 norm to avoid float32 overflow.

The agreement figures below come from a one-off comparison against an independent ONNX reference runtime, run outside
this repository; that tooling is not part of it, so those figures cannot be reproduced from here. What the repository
does check is listed under "Agreement and regression coverage".

## Downloading a model

**Settings ▸ Faces ▸ Download** (or Photo ▸ Detect Faces, which offers it for the detector):

1. A dialog shows the model's licence, whether commercial use is allowed, what it was trained on (or that this is not
   known) and which site the file comes from. **Download stays disabled until you tick "I have read these terms and
   accept them for my own use".** Nothing is fetched before that.
2. LightKub downloads the file from the model's own repository (GitHub for YuNet and SFace, Hugging Face for
   AuraFace), at an address pinned to a commit, over https, in pure Rust (the `lightcraft-fetch` crate: no `curl`, no
   OpenSSL). An interrupted download resumes where it stopped.
3. The file must match the model's recorded size and SHA-256, or it is thrown away. A file that matches is installed
   by itself. Nothing else is sent anywhere, and no token or account is involved.

**Open page** opens the model's own page in your browser if you would rather get the file yourself.

## Adding a model file yourself

Adding a model is how you say you want it: once it is installed it is **chosen and recognition is switched on**, with no
further step. The one question is its licence, and that comes first.

1. **Settings ▸ Faces ▸ Add a model file…**, or drop a `.onnx` file on the window.
2. LightKub looks at the file (it never runs it at this point): it recognises models it knows by their SHA-256, and
   for any other file it reads the input and output shapes and describes what it assumed (112 × 112 aligned faces,
   RGB, `(x − 127.5) / 127.5`, one vector per face: the ArcFace convention that InsightFace models also use).
3. The same dialog shows the licence, whether commercial use is allowed and what the model was trained on, and
   **Install stays disabled until you tick the acceptance box**.
4. The model is copied into LightKub's models folder and checked against the original by hash.

Non-commercial models (InsightFace, for example) can be added this way for your own use; LightKub never bundles,
hosts, downloads or links them from a picker, and the dialog says so.

The newest model is the one in use. An earlier one stays installed, **Use** switches back, and each model keeps its own
cache of embeddings (`face-embeddings-<model id>.bin` in the library folder), so going back does not start over. Removing
the model in use hands over to another installed one. Results of the model that was running when you switched are
discarded, never mixed into the new one's index.

### Bring your own models: `catalog.json`

LightKub's built-in list only holds models whose terms let the project point at them. For anything else (a stronger
recogniser whose weights are for research use, a model you trained, a mirror you trust) put a `catalog.json` in the models
folder. Each entry is a model manifest plus the address to fetch it from, and it then gets the same **Download** button as
a built-in model, with its licence notice shown before anything is fetched. LightKub ships and links to none of them: what
the file says, and whether you may use the weights, is yours to check (the dialog shows the notice you wrote, in a warning
colour unless you marked the model `"commercial": "yes"`).

```json
{ "models": [ {
    "id": "my-recogniser", "name": "My recogniser (R50)", "version": "1", "role": "embedder",
    "url": "https://example.org/weights/recogniser.onnx",
    "sha256": "(64 lowercase hex digits)", "sizeBytes": 166000000,
    "licence": { "name": "Research use only", "commercial": "no", "notice": "Not for commercial use." },
    "provenance": "Trained on ...",
    "output": { "kind": "embedding", "dim": 512 },
    "thresholds": { "matchCosine": 0.4 },
    "speed": 1.7
} ] }
```

`speed` is optional: how many times faster the model is than a ResNet-100 (1.7 for a ResNet-50, 7 for a MobileFaceNet; see the
next section). Settings ▸ Faces shows it as "1.7× faster than a ResNet-100 model", also before the model is downloaded; leave it
out if you have not measured it and nothing is shown. `input` may be left out (112 × 112 RGB, `(x − 127.5) / 127.5`, the ArcFace convention that InsightFace-style models use); say
otherwise with `"input": {"width": 112, "height": 112, "colour": "bgr", "mean": [0,0,0], "std": [1,1,1]}`. `sha256` and
`sizeBytes` are required (a download is checked against them), the address must be `https`, and the model must give one
vector per face. A bad entry is reported in Settings ▸ Faces and skipped; the rest still load. The same file by hand
(Add a model file…) is recognised by its hash and gets the terms you wrote. Models you cannot or do not want to list can
still be added by file; non-commercial models are never offered by the built-in list.

The models folder is `<config>/models` (`%APPDATA%\LightKub\models` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/LightKub/models`
on macOS, `~/.config/lightkub/models` on Linux), or `$LIGHTKUB_FACE_MODELS`. The desktop app, the CLI and the MCP
server share it.

## What is known about the models LightKub recognises

| Model | Licence of the weights | Trained on | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| YuNet 2023mar (detector) | MIT | WIDER FACE | 232 KB |
| AuraFace v1 | Apache-2.0 | "a commercial dataset", undisclosed | 261 MB; the best measured on sculpted busts |
| SFace 2021dec | labelled Apache-2.0 | undocumented (the upstream repository mentions CASIA-WebFace, VGGFace2, MS1MV2) | 39 MB; two questions about commercial use are unanswered upstream |

"Commercial use allowed" in the dialog is the weights' licence; it says nothing about the training data.

## How fast are the models

The current pure-Rust runner was measured in standard release mode (no `target-cpu=native`) on Windows,
Ryzen 9 7945HX, over **40 aligned photographic crops** from `corpus/public-faces` (public-domain sources in
`SOURCES.tsv`). Each call runs on one thread. Preprocessing, inference and unit normalization are included;
model loading, photo decoding, detection and alignment are excluded.

| Model | Pure Rust / face (median) | Speed (R100 = 1×) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| SFace 2021dec (39 MB) | **33.82–36.29 ms** | **6.9×** |
| AuraFace v1 (261 MB) | **233.18–252.14 ms** | **1×** |

The ranges are medians from two runs (the rerun reproduced the same embedding errors).
Five faces cost about **169–181 ms with SFace**, or **1.17–1.26 s with AuraFace**, just for recognition; ten faces cost
338–363 ms / 2.33–2.52 s. Decoding, detecting and aligning the photo add to this. The background scan parallelizes photos
using its existing bounded worker pools; the recognizer never creates an inner pool. These serial estimates do not imply
whole-library throughput. Convolution dominates the profiled model time. Dense kernels lower at most 256 positions
with contiguous plane copies and explicit border masks; depthwise kernels remain direct. CPU-dispatched Rust
AVX-512 intrinsics improve supported x86 CPUs; other CPUs and wasm use the dependency's Rust fallback.
AuraFace remains a costly CPU choice (its load time is 120–172 ms).

SFace's builtin speed metadata now uses the measured 6.9× ratio. User `catalog.json` ratios remain user-provided.
Older published tables for MobileFaceNet/R50/R100 came from a different runtime and are not measurements of this runner; architecture
names alone do not guarantee the same speed, and those additional model files were not verified in this task.

### Agreement and regression coverage

The public-crop embeddings match the reference runtime's outputs:

| Model | Maximum absolute component difference | Mean absolute difference | Minimum cosine | Mean cosine |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| SFace | 2.0266e-6 | 2.0542e-7 | 0.999999999992 | 0.999999999994 |
| AuraFace | 1.2219e-6 | 1.2725e-7 | 0.999999999990 | 0.999999999993 |

Maximum component difference relative to the largest reference component was 8.60e-6 / 7.10e-6, below 1e-3.
Twenty seeded synthetic recognition nets also agree (maximum absolute embedding difference 7.45e-7).
Unit regressions cover normalization, PReLU broadcasting, transposed Gemm/optional bias, odd grouped convolutions,
reuse of padding, retained scratch/constant-copy limits, invalid manifests, overflow, concurrent calls, and malformed/truncated/ambiguous ONNX fields.
These establish inference agreement, not face-identification accuracy or Lightroom parity.

The shared YuNet graph is also compared against the reference runtime on four synthetic pictures. It passes an absolute
1e-6 plus relative 1e-3 tolerance. The reference's sigmoid uses a clamped rational approximation; LightKub keeps its existing
exponential sigmoid. Tiny confidence outputs differ by at most 4.47e-7 absolute (6.44% relative on the blank picture),
far below the 0.6 detection threshold. Neither pinned recognizer uses Sigmoid. No approximate activation or reduced
precision was introduced to get the speed figures.

`LC_FACE_MODELS=<folder> cargo test --release -p lightcraft-faces runtime::tests::real_models_pass_the_self_test -- --ignored --nocapture`
runs the installation checks against locally supplied, hash-recognized model files. Models/crops stay out of git.

### And how well do they recognise?

Published numbers only, each copied from the model's own page (we have not re-run them). Higher is better. They are
standard face-verification benchmarks: **IJB-C** (hard, mixed-quality photos; true-accept rate at one false accept in
10,000), **CFP-FP** (frontal against profile) and **AgeDB-30** (years apart), both in percent.

| Model | Speed (R100 = 1×) | IJB-C | CFP-FP | AgeDB-30 | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MobileFaceNet (InsightFace buffalo_s / buffalo_sc) | 7× faster | 95.02 | 98.00 | 96.58 | InsightFace model zoo |
| SFace (OpenCV Zoo) | 6.9× faster (current Rust) | not given | not given | not given | OpenCV Zoo says 0.9940 on a set it does not name |
| ResNet-50 (InsightFace buffalo_l) | 1.7× faster | 97.25 | 99.33 | 98.23 | InsightFace model zoo |
| ResNet-100 (AuraFace v1) | 1× | not given | 95.19 | 96.10 | its Hugging Face page |
| TopoFR R50 / R100 / R200 (Glint360K) | 1.7× / 1× / 0.5× | 97.27 / 97.60 / 97.84 | not given | not given | TopoFR repository |

Read with care: the sources report different sets, so the blanks are not zeros and the rows are not all on the same
yardstick. What the numbers do say: a ResNet-50 recogniser is about two points above a MobileFaceNet on IJB-C, a ResNet-100
or 200 adds only a few tenths more, and AuraFace's published CFP-FP and AgeDB-30 are below buffalo_l's ResNet-50 despite being
a ResNet-100 (so it is not the accuracy choice its size suggests). InsightFace's pretrained weights are, in its own words,
"available for non-commercial research purposes only"; TopoFR's page states no licence for its weights.

## Finding faces yourself

**Photo ▸ Detect Faces** (`faces.detect`) runs the YuNet detector on the selected photos and adds what it finds as
unnamed face boxes, in one undo step. A new run replaces earlier detections; boxes that came from XMP, or that you drew or
named, are never touched (and a face that already has one is not boxed a second time), and no sidecar is written. It looks at the photo upright and uncropped with default settings,
so your edits and crops do not matter. `apply: false` only reports. It finds faces of about 10 pixels and up in a
640-pixel version of the photo (so very small faces in a large group photo can be missed; looking at tiles is planned).
The detector's output matches OpenCV's own YuNet on a 45-photo public-domain test set (97 of 99 faces found by both,
mean box overlap 0.97), including marble busts and paintings, with no false boxes on the landscape and architecture
photos in the set.

## Suggesting who is in a photo

With **Recognise faces** switched on in Settings ▸ Faces and a recognition model chosen (**Use**), LightKub works out, in
the background, what each face in your library looks like to the model, and uses the faces you have already named to
suggest names for the ones you have not:

- An unnamed face with a good match gets a dim label such as **Jane Doe?** in the loupe. Click it and the name box opens
  with the guess filled in; Enter confirms. Any other unnamed face shows **Add name** when you point at it. Clicking a name
  lets you change it, and clearing the box removes it. Typing completes from the people you have already named.
- **Nothing is ever named for you.** A suggestion is only a label until you confirm it, and a suggestion appears only when
  the match is strong *and* clearly ahead of the next person: it is better to leave a face unnamed than to name it wrongly.
  Naming a face also makes it one of the faces the others are compared with, so the suggestions improve as you go.
- Faces come from the names other apps wrote into your photos (read from XMP), from Photo ▸ Detect Faces, or both. A face is
  aligned using the detector's five landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners) when it finds the same face, and cut out by its box
  otherwise.
- Everything stays on your computer. The embeddings (one short list of numbers per face) are cached in the library folder in
  `face-embeddings-<model id>.bin`, one file per model, so switching models back and forth does not start over; they are
  not part of the catalog and not written to XMP.

### The background scan

Turning recognition on starts a scan of the whole library, once, in the background:

- A photo that already has face boxes (from XMP, or drawn, or named) has its faces embedded.
- A photo with **no** face boxes at all is searched with the detector, and what it is sure of becomes that photo's unnamed
  face boxes (marked "Detected by YuNet", so a manual Detect Faces replaces them), embedded in the same pass. Photos are
  searched once: `face-scanned.bin` in the library folder remembers which, so a photo whose boxes you remove is not boxed
  again. These boxes are LightKub's own bookkeeping: not an undo step, never written to a sidecar.
- Photos you have named faces in go first, then the rest. Raw files are read through the camera's embedded preview (much
  faster than decoding the raw); everything else is rendered at 2048 pixels.
- **How hard it works follows what you are doing.** The app tells the engine on every call to `faces.pump`, which is made
  about 20 times a second while there is work and a few times a minute otherwise (the window is not redrawn for it at any
  other time). Dragging, typing or scrolling: nothing new is started. The pointer moving, or the window minimized:
  **light**, one photo at a time on two threads. Idle for three seconds, or the window still on screen but with another
  app in front (you are working elsewhere): **normal**, half of the processor's threads. Idle and looking at the progress
  (Settings ▸ Faces, or the People view): **full**, four fifths. Photos already running are never interrupted, and a
  change of pace takes effect at once.
- **Threads and photos.** Most of a photo's cost is its parallel work (decoding, developing the picture), so the pace sets the
  size of a pool of threads for that work: two, half the machine, four fifths. The scan has pools of its own, not the one the
  loupe and exports use (which has no priorities), so a slider drag never queues behind a scan. Earlier measurements (with a different runner) on a 32-thread
  desktop with 4 photos at once: about 6.4 photos a second at full pace (a pool of 25 threads), 6.0 at normal (16) and 1.8
  when light (2 threads).
- **Memory** limits the number of photos at once as much as the processor does: a photo in progress holds about 180 MB
  (peak memory grew by that much per extra worker), so at most half of the memory budget (a quarter of the RAM, at most
  1.5 GiB, unless `LIGHTKUB_MEMORY_MB` says otherwise) is given to them: about four photos at once on a default setup,
  whatever the core count. Eight at once was not much faster and needed about twice the memory (a 2.0 GB peak against
  1.1 GB). `LIGHTKUB_FACE_THREADS` replaces these limits with a number of your own. A couple more photos wait behind
  the running ones, so a worker that finishes has its next photo at once.
- **Earlier scan speed (a different runner).** A mixed raw and JPEG library of 184 photos (the raws read through their embedded previews, 73 photos searched
  for faces) took about 29 seconds on that machine at full pace: roughly 6 photos a second, so the first scan of 10,000 photos
  is a matter of half an hour; after that only new photos are looked at. Settings ▸ Faces shows how many are left, with a progress bar, and the activity stack shows "Finding faces" meanwhile. After you accept a model's terms
  you are returned to that tab, so the download and then the scan can be watched there; the main window has no status bar.
- Opening another library starts a fresh scan state; nothing learned about one library is used in another.

### The People view

Until recognition is set up, a line at the top says what it takes and has one button: **Set up face recognition** (no model
yet: it opens Settings ▸ Faces, where the download is) or **Turn on** (a model is installed, recognition is off: it switches it
on there and then). The loupe's name box offers the same ("Set up name suggestions…" / "Turn on name suggestions"), and so
does a person's page.

**People** shows a card for each named person (their face, with the number of photos they are in on the picture) and, below
a line, the **Unnamed faces**: every face nobody has named, as cropped pictures. With recognition running, faces that look
alike are next to each other (put in order by looking at every pair, for up to the first 1,500 embedded faces), and a face
the named ones recognise carries the name they suggest along its bottom edge; click that name to accept it for that face.
To name a group: click faces to select them (Shift-click selects a range, **Select all** takes every one listed), type a
name in the bar that appears (people already named complete as you type), press Enter: all of them are named at once, as
one undo step. Selecting names nothing.

The thumbnail-size slider in the bottom bar sizes the faces here too, with limits of their own. Every face is shown by the
same kind of box: the detector's own box once the scan has looked at it (kept beside its embedding), so a loosely drawn box
from another tool does not make one face look farther away than the next; before the scan has looked at a face it is shown
by its own box.

### A person's page

In **People**, a click on a person opens their page: **only cropped faces**, never whole photos. First the faces named
with their name (a click opens that photo), then **More**: the unnamed faces that look like them, most alike first. Click one
to confirm it (that names the face, as one undo step, and it moves up into their faces), or × to hide it for this session.
**Show photos** puts their photos in the grid; **‹ People** or Escape goes back. "More" only holds faces the scan has
already embedded, so it fills in as the scan goes; it shows faces scoring above four fifths of the model's suggestion bar,
since you look at each one before anything is named.

How well it works: on 755 named faces of marble busts from one museum folder (each face hidden in turn and matched against
shots taken more than five seconds apart), SFace named the right person first 95.5% of the time and AuraFace 94.7%; at
the starting thresholds LightKub suggests (SFace 0.55, AuraFace 0.40) about 97% of the suggestions were right. Busts are
a hard case in some ways (no skin or hair to go by) and an easy one in others (the same sculpture looks the same in every
shot), so check a model on your own photos before trusting it:

`faces.evaluate` tests a model on *your* photos: it hides each named face in turn, asks who it looks like from the others
(ignoring shots taken within a few seconds of it, which would make it too easy) and reports, for each threshold, how many
suggestions it would make and how many were right.

## Commands

All of this is reachable from the control channel, the CLI and MCP: `faces.models.list`, `faces.models.inspect {path}`,
`faces.models.install {path, acknowledged: true, activate?}`, `faces.models.download {id, acknowledged: true}` (then `faces.models.downloads`, which also installs what has arrived, and `faces.models.downloadCancel {id}`), `faces.models.remove {id}`, `faces.models.select {id}`,
`faces.enable {enabled?}`, `faces.detect {ids?, apply?}`, `faces.index {budgetMs?, ids?}`, `faces.pump` (what the app calls every frame), `faces.suggest {ids?, threshold?, margin?}`, `faces.person {name, more?}` (a person's faces and the unnamed faces that look like them), `faces.unnamed {limit?}` (every unnamed face, look-alikes together, with suggested names), `faces.setName {id?, index, name}`, `faces.nameFaces {faces: [{photo, index}], name}` (name many at once, one undo step) and `faces.evaluate`. `acknowledged` must be `true`: the caller has shown the user the terms and the user agreed. Installing makes the model the one in use and switches recognition on unless `activate` is `false`.
